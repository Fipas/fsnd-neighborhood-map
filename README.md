# Project 5 - Neighborhood Map

Neighborhood Map is the fifth project required for graduation in the Udacity Web Full Stack Nanodegree.

# About

This project consists in developing a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. The project rubric can be found [here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2218/view).

The city of London was chosen for this project. Map markers are used to identify popular locations, a search function is implemented to easily discover these locations and a listview is employed to support simple browsing of all locations. [Wikimedia REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/#/Talk%20pages) is used to provide additional information about each of these locations. [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/) was used to implement the map.
